      Dear Parents and Students,<br><br>
      It is my joy and privilege to welcome you back for another great year at Krupanidhi Christ Convent And High School. We are very excited to have you back once again filling the corridors of our school with energy and enthusiasm to start anew. Let me begin with a hearty congratulations to our grade 10th (ICSE &amp; CBSE), PU and ISC batch 2018-19 on their excellent performance in the exams! You have made us so proud! Congratulations also to our dear teachers who with their dedication and tireless efforts have enabled our students to bring academic laurels to our school.
      I prayerfully commission our new batch of Grade 10 students to carry on the mantle. At Krupanidhi Christ Convent And High School we have great teachers who spend hours planning and designing curriculum suited to immerse our children in learning and discovery.
    </p>

    <p class="justify-content-center" style="padding-top: 2%; padding-bottom: 7%;">
      It is our mission to transform our students into enlightened individuals who have the heart to give back to society and be a light unto the world. At Krupanidhi Christ Convent And High School, we strive to challenge our students to reach their highest potential whether in academics or co-curricular pursuits. We believe our students must step out into the world prepared to face the demands of worthy careers and effective citizenship. It is truly a privilege to be part of a community where parents, teachers and students work together to build positive relationships that support academic and social growth. Let us strive to preserve the wonderful legacy we have created together.
