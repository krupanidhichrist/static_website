        Dear Parents and Students,<br><br>
        It is my joy and privilege to welcome you back for another great year at Krupanidhi Christ Convent And High School. We are very excited to have you back once again filling the corridors of our school with energy and enthusiasm to start anew. Let me begin with a hearty congratulations to our grade 10th (ICSE & CBSE), PU and ISC batch 2018-19 on their excellent performance in the exams! You have made us so proud! Congratulations also to our dear teachers who with their dedication and tireless efforts have enabled our students to bring academic laurels to our school. I prayerfully commission our new batch of Grade 10 students to carry on the mantle. At Krupanidhi Christ Convent And High School we have great teachers who spend hours planning and designing curriculum suited to immerse our children in learning and discovery.
      </p>
